# 🧪 Manual UI Testing – AutomationExercise

## 👋 Introduction
This folder documents my complete manual UI testing work for the [AutomationExercise](https://automationexercise.com) website. The goal was to explore and test the most critical user flows — like Signup, Login, Cart, and Checkout — from a real-world QA perspective.

Everything here was tested manually using planned test cases and some exploratory testing. I've also included clear documentation, screenshots, and bug reports — just like you'd see in a real QA process.

## 📊 Test Overview

- ✅ Total Test Cases: 41
- 🟩 Passed: 34
- 🟥 Failed: 7
- 🐞 Bugs Found: 10  
   - From test execution: 7  
   - From exploratory testing: 3

## 📎 Screenshot Usage

- Screenshots were captured for all major UI test cases — especially for those that failed.
- Out of 7 failed test cases:
  - **7 were logged as bugs** and linked in `/Bug-Reports`
- Additionally, **3 bugs were found through exploratory testing** and included separately.
- All screenshots are stored under `/Screenshots`, categorized by Test Case or Bug ID.

This structure reflects real-world QA practices — not every failure turns into a formal bug, especially for low-priority or cosmetic issues.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – test case & execution tracking
- Screenshots – for bug evidence
- Markdown – bug documentation
- Exploratory Testing – to find edge-case issues

## ✍️ Notes
This project is part of my QA portfolio to show how I approach manual testing professionally — covering both planned and spontaneous real-world scenarios. All test evidence is properly documented and version-controlled.
