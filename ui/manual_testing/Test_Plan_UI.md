# 🧾 Test Plan – Manual UI Testing

## 📝 Project
AutomationExercise – Manual Testing of UI Functionality

## 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of this testing effort is to validate the core UI components of AutomationExercise — such as user login, signup, shopping cart, and checkout — ensuring they function correctly and offer a smooth user experience.

---

## 🔍 Scope
This testing plan focuses on the **functional aspects of the UI** only. It covers:
- Valid and invalid input handling
- Field validations and form behaviors
- Button clicks, form submissions, and page navigation
- Comparison of expected vs. actual user flows

---

## 📤 Deliverables
- ✅ Test Cases (`TestCases_UI.xlsx`)
- ✅ Test Execution Summary (`TestExecution_Summary.md`)
- ✅ Bug Reports (`bug_report.md`)
- ✅ Screenshots of extected cases and bugs (`/Screenshots/`)
- ✅ Final Summary Report (`Summary_UI_Testing.md`)

---

## ✅ Entry Criteria
- Website is accessible
- Core UI features (Signup, Login, Cart, Checkout, etc.) are implemented

## ❌ Exit Criteria
- All test cases executed
- Major bugs identified and documented
- Summary and supporting documentation are finalized

---

## 🧪 Environment
- Device: Desktop (Laptop)
- OS: Windows 10
- Browser: Google Chrome v137
- Tools: Excel, Markdown, Screenshot utility (Snipping Tool)

---

## 🧾 Assumptions
- Backend/API validation is not required
- UI remains stable during the testing phase
- Only dummy/test credentials are used

---

## ⚠️ Risks
- Changes to the live website may invalidate test steps or results
- No user data is saved, so limited persistence testing is possible
