# API Manual Testing

This folder contains manual testing assets focused on API validation and verification for AutomationExercise.

## Contents

- Comprehensive manual test cases covering positive, negative, boundary, and edge scenarios for each API endpoint.
- Test data sets used during manual execution.
- Exploratory testing notes and findings.
- Bug reports raised from manual testing activities.

## Purpose

Manual API testing here acts as the foundation for identifying core defects, verifying business logic, and validating response behavior before automating.

## Best Practices

- Test cases are detailed with preconditions, input data, expected results, and postconditions.
- Exploratory testing complements scripted test cases to uncover unexpected behaviors.
- Bugs discovered manually are documented and linked to test cases for traceability.
