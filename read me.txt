🚀 Week 3 QA Portfolio Update – My First Steps in Cypress UI Automation!

After completing manual UI testing and API automation (Postman + Newman), I finally stepped into the world of frontend test automation with Cypress — and I’m loving it!

🎯 What I automated this week:
✅ Basic UI test cases like Signup, Login
✅ Cypress setup with organized folder structure
✅ CLI test run with green “✓” results
✅ Pushed code to GitHub with a clear README

🧠 Key Learnings:

Locating elements with .get() and using .should() for assertions

Importance of reusable test structure (describe, beforeEach)

Cypress makes UI test feedback instant and visual

🔜 What’s next:
Automating more flows like Add to Cart, Checkout, and combining API + UI validations

🚀 My goal is a complete QA portfolio from manual → automation → CI/CD

Curious: What helped you feel confident in Cypress early on?
